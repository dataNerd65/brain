Hacking into my brain with projects
Peter Kiarie - "The more I do it many times, the more it sinks"

This repository will have mini projects for the understanding of programming and mostly
on the Computer Science concept of Data Structures and Algorithms. I target taking part 
in Competitive Programming contests in:
- UVA Online Problemset- (Training on this)
- Codeforces
- Leetcode
- AtCoder etc

I will start off with C++ for it is fast in Algorithms and will make console applications
![CPP](brain/c-.png)
then switch to python or Java. I got the basics but have not cemented them in my brain.

NB: I will not copy from AI but will research from it concepts and understand them fully.

Copying from AI will make me not understand the concepts well. 

## Future plans
- Competitive Programming
- Competitive Engineer
- Researcher of Algorithms and Data Structures
- A happy man

God help me please.
